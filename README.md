# Dirtysock DLL Proxy for Unravel

Features:
- Well, nothing... only the ASI loader. You gotta start somewhere, right?

Tested with game version 1.0.0.27803.

-----------------------------------------------------------

ASI loader - original code by listener ([XLiveLess](http://gtaforums.com/topic/388658-relgtaiv-xliveless/))<br />
The ASI loader allows for loading of DLL files without the need of a separate injector. These DLL files must be renamed to *.asi and put in the same folder of the game's executable or in a subfolder named "asi".

-----------------------------------------------------------

Binary only: [Mediafire](http://www.mediafire.com/download/5yn8vu83ovua72v/dirtysock.7z)

**Usage:**<br />
Rename original 'dirtysock.dll' to 'dirtysock.bak', then put the proxy dll in its place.
